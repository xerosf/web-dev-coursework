					<i class="fa fa-solid fa-bullseye"></i> Key Targets of
					Climate Action
				</h1>
				<p>
					Climate action represents our collective effort to combat
					climate change and its impacts through policy, innovation,
					and behavioral changes. The Paris Agreement aims to limit
					global warming to well below 2Â°C above pre-industrial
					levels, while the UN Sustainable Development Goal 13 calls
					for urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
					These frameworks guide international cooperation to reduce
					emissions, build resilience, and transition to a
					sustainable, low-carbon future.

					<h2>
						<i class="fas fa-industry"></i> Carbon Emission
						Reduction
					</h2>
					<p>
						Reducing carbon emissions is central to mitigating
						climate change. Countries worldwide have committed to
						Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that outline
						their emission reduction targets. The goal is to achieve
						a 45% reduction in global carbon emissions by 2030 and
						reach net-zero emissions by 2050 to prevent the worst
						impacts of climate change.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<h2>
						<i class="fas fa-bolt"></i> Renewable Energy Adoption
					</h2>
					<p>
						Transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy
						sources like solar, wind, and hydropower is essential
						for decarbonizing our energy systems. The target is to
						increase the share of renewable energy in the global
						energy mix to at least 50% by 2030, creating cleaner
						air, more jobs, and greater energy security while
						reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<h2>
						<i class="fas fa-bus"></i> Sustainable Transportation
					</h2>
					<p>
						Transportation accounts for nearly a quarter of global
						CO2 emissions. Targets include electrifying public
						transport fleets, increasing the market share of
						electric vehicles to 30% by 2030, expanding cycling
						infrastructure in urban areas, and developing
						sustainable aviation fuels to reduce the carbon
						footprint of the transportation sector.

				<h2>Priority Action Areas</h2>
				<div class="featured-cards">
					<div class="featured-card">
						<i class="fas fa-tree fa-3x"></i>
						<h3>Reforestation Efforts</h3>
						<p>
							Forests absorb about 2 billion tons of CO2 annually.
							Global initiatives aim to halt deforestation and
							restore 350 million hectares of degraded landscapes
							by 2030, enhancing carbon sinks while protecting
							biodiversity and supporting local communities.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="featured-card">
						<i class="fas fa-wind fa-3x"></i>
						<h3>Solar and Wind Energy</h3>
						<p>
							The rapid deployment of solar and wind energy is
							critical for decarbonization. The International
							Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) targets a tripling
							of renewable energy capacity by 2030, with solar and
							wind projects leading the way in cost-effective
							clean energy solutions.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="featured-card">
						<i class="fas fa-recycle fa-3x"></i>
						<h3>Waste Reduction & Recycling</h3>
						<p>
							Reducing waste and implementing circular economy
							principles can cut emissions by 39% in
							material-intensive sectors. Targets include reducing
							food waste by 50% by 2030, phasing out single-use
							plastics, and achieving 65% recycling rates in
							developed countries.

				<h2>What Can You Do?</h2>
				<div class="featured-cards">
					<div class="featured-card">
						<i class="fas fa-lightbulb fa-3x"></i>
						<h3>Reduce Energy Consumption</h3>
						<p>
							Simple actions like switching to LED bulbs,
							improving home insulation, and using
							energy-efficient appliances can reduce your carbon
							footprint by up to 30%. Set a personal goal to
							reduce your household energy use by 10% this year.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="featured-card">
						<i class="fas fa-balance-scale fa-3x"></i>
						<h3>Advocate for Climate Policies</h3>
						<p>
							Your voice matters! Contact elected officials,
							support climate-focused organizations, and
							participate in community initiatives. Collective
							advocacy has been proven to accelerate policy
							changes necessary for meeting climate targets.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="featured-card">
						<i class="fas fa-shopping-bag fa-3x"></i>
						<h3>Support Sustainable Brands</h3>
						<p>
							Consumer choices drive market trends. Research
							companies' environmental commitments, choose
							products with sustainable certifications, and reduce
							consumption of high-impact goods. Supporting
							eco-friendly businesses creates demand for more
							sustainable practices across industries.
